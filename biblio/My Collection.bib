abstract = {The thermally activated chemical source of electric energy is one of the alternative sources. Anodes for such batteries are made of lithium-boron composite. The use of electromagnetic stirring in the technology of production of such material makes it possible to obtain a good quality distribution of boron powder in a lithium melt. As the source of the electromagnetic field two, inductors of travelling magnetic field (TMF) are used. The TMF inductor system allows to generate different flow patterns as one-, two-vortex or more vortex tricky flow structures. The mass transfer in the melt is computed using a three-dimensional k-! SST turbulence model. A 3D electromagnetic model was used for a Lorenz force density computation. Coupling of the proposed numerical models was performed by means of COMSOL Multiphysics.},

A 3D model of the adapted laboratory facility for a composite with an iron mass fraction of 70% was studied. Previously measured electrical, thermal and magnetic physical parameters of the composites were used in the model. The problems of heat dis- tribution in the adapted lining and the coupled electromagnetic-hydrodynamic-thermal problem of temperature equalization in molten metal stirring were numerically modelled. A comparison of the results obtained for the standard and for the adapted stirrer has shown that the composite inserts can be used to decrease the temperature equalization time more than twice, whereas the thermal effect decreases by more than 1.1 times.},

@article{Smolyanov2019,
abstract = {The main purpose of the work is to suggest the technique of solving multi-physics problems (calculation of magnetic, temperature and velocity fields) for the purpose of units with forced cooling system and complex shapes. The general problem is the presence of narrow region in which it is necessary to calculate the velocity field of a cooling liquid. The problem is solved by a simplified method based on a detailed equivalent circuit, which significantly reduces required computational resources in comparison with numerical methods (finite element and finite volume methods). The paper presents the transition from partial differential equations to algebraic equations, created on the basis of detailed equivalent circuits. The results of the model are analyzed on a real linear induction motor applied in the transport system. Thermal modes are being considered depending on cooling intensity and magnitude of power supply parameters of the motor. It is proposed to reduce the computation time by simplified calculation of the velocity field using an analytical coefficient obtained from the analysis of the equivalent circuits. The vectorization of cycles intended for building the stiffness matrix, storage of the matrix in sparse form, and rational sequences of matrix calculations in the course of the solution made it possible to reduce the computational time almost twice as well. The comparison of the accuracy of the results obtained is presented, depending on the discretization of the computational domain and chosen type of interpolation. Verification results of electromagnetic and thermal calculations obtained from experimental data are also presented.},

Modeling of electromagnetic processes of an induction pump is carried out using open source finite element package Elmer, and Comsol Multiphysics was chosen as a commercial package. The comparison has been made according to thrust and magnetic field pattern obtained by the three-dimensional and two-dimensional models. Due to the presence of transverse edge effect, the thrusts differ from ones obtained in the two-dimensional model. For this reason, in order to obtain more accuracy results, a coefficient of the transverse edge effect is introduced to the two-dimensional formulation. Also, as an additional task, a comparison of different coefficients of transverse edge effect with respect to varying widths of the secondary element is outlined. Ultimately, based on the data obtained, a conclusion on correctness of using open source software and the coefficients of transverse edge effect has been made.},

It is shown that the shape of the Hartmann velocity distribution and velocity profile in the duct depends on the spatial distribution of the travelling magnetic field. The obtained results indicate that the longitudinal end effect influences the velocity distribution along the duct, and the transverse end effect does not change qualitatively the behavior of flows, but affects the flow velocity magnitude.
